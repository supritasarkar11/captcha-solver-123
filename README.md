# CAPTCHA Solver Interface# CAPTCHA Solver InterfaceThis project provides a simple, single-file HTML interface for interacting with CAPTCHA images. It's designed as a client-side demonstration, focusing on loading CAPTCHA images and allowing user input for solving them.## Features- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly layout.- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Loads CAPTCHA images from a `url` query parameter (e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`).- **Default Image**: If no `url` parameter is provided, it defaults to the attached `sample.png`.- **User Input**: Provides an input field for users to enter their perceived CAPTCHA solution.- **Basic Validation**: For `sample.png`, it includes client-side validation against a hardcoded solution (`ADORS`). For external images, it indicates that a true solver would require backend processing.## How to Use1.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.2.  **Solve `sample.png`**: The page will initially display `sample.png`. Enter `ADORS` into the input field and click 'Submit CAPTCHA'.3.  **Load Custom CAPTCHA Image**: To load an image from a URL, append `?url=` followed by the full image URL to `index.html`.For example: `index.html?url=https://www.example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png`**Note**: For security reasons, browsers may block loading images from different origins (CORS policy) if the external server does not explicitly allow it.## Limitations- **Client-Side Only**: This is a client-side interface only. It does *not* include a real image processing CAPTCHA solver.- **No True Solver**: For images loaded via URL, it cannot programmatically
